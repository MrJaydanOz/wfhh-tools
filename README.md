# WFHH Tools (West Footscray Haunted House Tools)

This is a mobile web app made with React and Firebase designed to easily log the arrival of every single 
customer of West Footscray's Haunted House.

## How it works

- First at the bottom of the page you define your ID (it can be just your name) and a current time. The
current time should be synced to the surveillance footage time.
- Next press '`TAP TO START`' to make the timer start counting.
- Now that the timer is counting and authourised, you can now press one of the '`+1`' buttons and the time
of when they were pressed is recorded in a remote database.
- Later when you want to retrive all the button presses you can scroll to the bottom and press
'`DOWNLOAD DATABASE`'.

Below the '`+1`' buttons are some additional inputs to allow the adding of tags to make the next entry more
specific. The pink one allows adding a comment and the black one allows setting the camera number.

It's available to view [here](https://mrjaydanoz.github.io/wfhh-tools/) with the database as read only.
